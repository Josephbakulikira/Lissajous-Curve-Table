# Lissajous-Curve-Table
---
### Requirements
      pip install pygame
---
### Commands
       'Esc' to close the window
       'R' to restart the simulation
---
### Bugs(issues)
  Instead of adding each point of the curve in a list and then looping through the whole list to draw each point,
  we can just save the capture of the screen and then load it as the background for the next frame , this can make the simulation much faster
